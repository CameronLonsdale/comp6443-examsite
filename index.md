Hello friends. After the past semester it has been a pleasure teaching you all. I hope you've enjoyed the wargames and materials as much as I have had building them.

I've structured the following exam to hopefully test your abilities that you've learned in the course. Hopefully these skills will help you in the future. It shouldn't be too difficult, but if you struggle to complete the challenges, don't fret, hoepfully the magic of scaling may come in to save you.

If you would like to contribute to how the course is run in later years, please don't hesitate to fill in this [feedback form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeWepkB0aaXgA_thVk-GNL6CQWI7CqI4h_HSRmaF4RG1hziQg/viewform?usp=sf_link).

Here are some spotify playlists so you can listen to them while you work:
